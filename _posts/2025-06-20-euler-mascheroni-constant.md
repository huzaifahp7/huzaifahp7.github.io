### The Euler-Mascheroni Constant

While revisiting the **coupon collector problem**, I came across the **Euler-Mascheroni constant**, denoted by:

$$
\gamma \approx 0.57794\ldots
$$

This constant appears in various areas of mathematics, especially in number theory and analysis. But how exactly does it arise, and what is its connection to the coupon collecting problem?
