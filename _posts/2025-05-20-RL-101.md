### A Brief Intro to RL Using an Analogy

A friend of mine who isn't quite well versed with the jargon, paradigms, algorithms, or techniques of machine learning, recently reached out to me in confusion.

He had stumbled upon the term *“agent”* while reading about a few startups. However, a quick Google search only made things worse. It redirected him to RL agents, and instead of clarifying things, it exposed to him numerous technical terms like *reward signals*, *environments*, *policies*, and *value functions*. However, the concept piqued his interest.

So he texted me:  
**"What does this RL stuff actually mean? Can you explain it in a more intuitive way?"**

[TBD]
