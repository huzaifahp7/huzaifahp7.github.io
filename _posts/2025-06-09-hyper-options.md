### High Yielding Performance Enhancing Reversible (HYPER) Options

While preparing from **Paul Wilmott's** excellent book on frequently asked quant interview questions (highly recommended), I came across an exotic financial instrument called the **High Yielding Performance Enhancing Reversible (HYPER)** option.


I thought it was a pretty fascinating instrument and worth a quick post.

### What is a HYPER Option?

A **HYPER option** is a type of exotic option, somewhat like an American option, in that it can be exercised **multiple times**. However, here’s the difference:

> Every time you exercise it, the option **reverses type** - from a **call** to a **put**, and vice versa.

That’s the “**reversible**” part of the acronym.

###  Let’s Understand It With a Toy Example

Imagine you start with a **call HYPER option**. If the underlying stock price spikes up, you **exercise the call** and lock in your gains. Now, the option **flips** into a **put**.

If the stock later falls, you can **exercise the put** — and the option flips **back into a call**.

This back-and-forth can continue (subject to specific contract terms), allowing the holder to ride both upward and downward market movements within a bounded time horizon.
