# A Beautiful Fibonacci Application from *102 Combinatorial Problems*

The book *102 Combinatorial Problems* by Titu Andreescu and Zuming Feng is one of my favorites to revise combinatorics for my research work as well as for interview prep.  
I came across one of my favorite problems in the book, which is also a beautiful application of the Fibonacci sequence.

The problem states:

> A set of positive integers has the triangle property if it has three distinct elements that are the lengths of the sides of a triangle whose area is positive.  
> Consider the set {4, 5, 6, ..., n} of consecutive positive integers, all of whose ten-element subsets have the triangle property.  
> What is the largest possible value of *n*?

When I first saw this problem, I immediately thought: "let’s walk backward."  
There is a recursive structure here — but how do you even use it in the first place?

Whenever there is a max or min problem, I tend to think:  
*"What is the n+1-th element that will make it not true?"*  

If it's a max problem, you ideally want to find the minimum element that will make it untrue — and vice versa.

So now, consider the set {4, 5, 6, ..., S}, where *S* is the minimum element where this is first untrue.  
Now pick an arbitrary subset {s₁, s₂, ..., s₁₀} from this set, and let s₁ < s₂ < ... < s₁₀.  

None of the three-element subsets from this can form a triangle.  
Thus, using the property of triangle sides (sum of two sides must always be greater than the third side), we have — because it does *not* satisfy the triangle property:

$$
S \geq s_{10} \geq s_9 + s_8 \geq (s_8 + s_7) + s_7 \geq \dots
$$

Now can you see the recursive structure, where Fibonacci might come into play?

Since it does not satisfy the triangle properties, we have:

$$
s_n \geq s_{n-1} + s_{n-2}
$$

Using this recursively, we get:

$$
S \geq s_{10} \geq s_9 + s_8 \geq (s_8 + s_7) + s_8 = 2s_8 + s_7 \geq 2(s_7 + s_6) + s_7 = 3s_7 + 2s_6 \geq 3(s_6 + s_5) + 2s_6 = 5s_6 + 3s_5 \dots
$$

Continuing this way:

$$
S \geq 34 s_2 + 21 s_1
$$

Now, we have:

$$
s_1 = 4 \quad \text{and} \quad s_2 = 5
$$

Thus:

$$
S \geq 34 \times 5 + 21 \times 4 = 254
$$

Therefore, 254 is the minimum value where this becomes untrue.  
Thus, *254 - 1 = 253* is the maximum number where this is true.

See how the Fibonacci sequence came into play?  
It is one of my personal favorite mathematical ideas, and I love solving DP problems in algorithms — Fibonacci being a common occurrence in those.
