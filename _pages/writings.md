## 1. Spring Semester — A Note to a Friend

This was during the spring semester.  
A friend of mine was stressed about life without any particular reason.  
It was a period of transition — and spring itself is a season of transition.

Thinking about his situation, I wrote to him in the morning:

> “Jab gham na ho, toh khushi se mehroom rehne mein kya faida.  
> Aur jab gham ho, toh khush rehne se behtar kaunsi barakat.”

This translates to:  
*"If there is no reason to be sad, what is the point in being deprived of happiness?  
And if there is a reason for your sadness, then there is no bigger blessing than being happy in those times."*

## 2. A Sunny Day in Atlanta

It was a sunny day in Atlanta.  
Being from Mumbai, I love when it’s sunny outside.  
Anyway, as a kid I always wondered why I could never look at the sun for prolonged periods without my eyes hurting.  

While walking to my class one day, I thought about this for a while.  
That night, I came up with this:

> There’s this concept of *zahir* and *batin* where *zahir* means what’s on the surface of the faith and *batin* is this inner, more spiritual dimension.  
> *“Often people seek the beauty of the sun’s rays (zahir). Those who seek the beauty of its source (batin) will never be devoid of light.”*

*"Light"* here is open for interpretation by the reader.
