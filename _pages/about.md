Hi, Hallo, नमस्ते, નમસ્તે, سلام!

I am a Computer Science and Mathematics student at Georgia Tech, with a deep passion for Quantitative Finance and its intersection with technology. My research interests span Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Data Science, and Algorithm Design. Like a beautiful ghazal that weaves together multiple layers of meaning, I aim to blend technical expertise with cultural understanding. As a polyglot fluent in multiple languages, I find profound beauty in the convergence of technology and cultural expression.

# About Me

I am currently pursuing my studies at Georgia Tech, focusing on the intersection of Computer Science and Mathematics. My interests lie in basically anything applying mathematical and computational methods to solve complex problems.

When I'm not immersed in code or mathematical proofs, you'll find me exploring the rich tapestry of languages and poetry. I'm fluent in five languages (English, Hindi, Urdu, Gujarati, and Marathi), with a limited working knowledge of German. I can also understand basic Arabic and Farsi, though I'm still working on speaking them. This multilingual journey has opened doors to some of the world's most profound literary traditions.

# Education

- B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics, Georgia Tech (Expected 2026)

# Cultural & Literary Interests

My passion for languages has led me to discover the mesmerizing world of classical poetry. I find particular inspiration in the works of:

Growing up, I looked up to the masters like Kabir, Rumi, Mirza Ghalib, Hafez, Meera Bai, Amir Khusrau, Rudaki, Rahim, and Ferdowsi - poets and scholars whose works transcend time and culture.

These literary traditions, with their intricate metaphors and profound wisdom, often influence my approach to problem-solving and creative thinking in my technical work.

Beyond poetry, I am an avid tea and fragrance connoisseur, with a carefully curated collection of over 50 unique tea varieties and more than 60 different fragrances.
