Student, researcher, wordsmith, and philosopher of sorts - exploring the intersections of quantitative finance, machine learning, algorithms and the occasional existential musing.

# About Me
I am a Computer Science and Mathematics student at Georgia Tech, passionate about using machine learning and mathematical methods to solve complex problems. Born and brought up in Mumbai, India, I've had the opportunity to experience diverse cultures through my time in Dubai during two summers and now in Atlanta. My research interests span algorithmic trading, natural language processing, and statistical modeling. Like a beautiful ghazal that weaves together multiple layers of meaning, I aim to blend technical expertise with cultural understanding. When I'm not immersed in code or mathematical proofs, you'll find me exploring the rich tapestry of languages and poetry. I'm fluent in five languages (English, Hindi, Urdu, Gujarati, and Marathi), with a limited working knowledge of German. I can also understand basic Arabic and Farsi, though I'm still working on speaking them. This multilingual journey has opened doors to some of the world's most profound literary traditions. My interests lie in developing innovative solutions at the intersection of mathematics, computer science, and finance.

# Cultural & Literary Interests

Hi, Hallo, नमस्ते, નમસ્તે, سلام!

My passion for languages has led me to discover the mesmerizing world of classical poetry and music. Growing up, I looked up to the masters like Kabir, Rumi, Mirza Ghalib, Hafez, Meera Bai, Amir Khusrau, Rudaki, Rahim, and Ferdowsi - poets and scholars whose works transcend time and culture. These literary traditions, with their intricate metaphors and profound wisdom, often influence my approach to problem-solving and creative thinking in my technical work. Beyond poetry and music, I am an avid tea and fragrance connoisseur, with a carefully curated collection of over 50 unique tea varieties and more than 60 different fragrances.
