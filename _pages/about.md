Welcome to my personal website! I am a Computer Science and Mathematics student at Georgia Tech, passionate about Machine Learning and Quantitative Research. Beyond the world of algorithms and data, I'm a polyglot who finds beauty in the intersection of technology and human expression.

# About Me

I am currently pursuing my studies at Georgia Tech, focusing on the intersection of Computer Science and Mathematics. My interests lie in Machine Learning research and Quantitative Research, where I aim to apply mathematical and computational methods to solve complex problems.

When I'm not immersed in code or mathematical proofs, you'll find me exploring the rich tapestry of languages and poetry. I'm fluent in six languages (English, Hindi, Urdu, Gujarati, Marathi, and German) and am currently expanding my linguistic horizons by learning Farsi and Arabic. This multilingual journey has opened doors to some of the world's most profound literary traditions.

# Research Interests

- Machine Learning

# Cultural & Literary Interests

My passion for languages has led me to discover the mesmerizing world of classical poetry. I find particular inspiration in the works of:

- Persian masters like Rumi, Rudaki, Hafez and Ferdowsi
- Urdu poets such as Mirza Ghalib and Amir Khusrau
- Indian poets including Kabir, Rahim, and Meera Bai

These literary traditions, with their intricate metaphors and profound wisdom, often influence my approach to problem-solving and creative thinking in my technical work.
