I am a Computer Science and Mathematics student at Georgia Tech, with a deep passion for Quantitative Finance and its intersection with technology. Born and brought up in Mumbai, India, I've had the opportunity to experience diverse cultures through my time in Dubai during two summers and now in Atlanta. My research interests span Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Data Science, and Algorithm Design. Like a beautiful ghazal that weaves together multiple layers of meaning, I aim to blend technical expertise with cultural understanding. As a polyglot fluent in multiple languages, I find profound beauty in the convergence of technology and cultural expression.

# About Me

I am currently pursuing my studies at Georgia Tech, focusing on the intersection of Computer Science and Mathematics. My interests lie in basically anything applying mathematical and computational methods to solve complex problems.

When I'm not immersed in code or mathematical proofs, you'll find me exploring the rich tapestry of languages and poetry. I'm fluent in five languages (English, Hindi, Urdu, Gujarati, and Marathi), with a limited working knowledge of German. I can also understand basic Arabic and Farsi, though I'm still working on speaking them. This multilingual journey has opened doors to some of the world's most profound literary traditions.

Hi, Hallo, नमस्ते, નમસ્તે, سلام!

My passion for languages has led me to discover the mesmerizing world of classical poetry and music. Growing up, I looked up to the masters like Kabir, Rumi, Mirza Ghalib, Hafez, Meera Bai, Amir Khusrau, Rudaki, Rahim, and Ferdowsi - poets and scholars whose works transcend time and culture. My musical tastes are equally diverse, spanning genres and eras. I'm deeply moved by the spiritual depths of Qawwali music, from legends like Abida Parveen to Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and the Sabri Brothers. Hip-hop captivates me through the mastery of artists from Rakim to Andre 3000 to A$AP Rocky. I enjoy exploring house music and pop, appreciate the timeless charm of Frank Sinatra, and cherish Bollywood music across generations - from Kishore Kumar to Udit Narayan to Arijit Singh. These literary and musical traditions, with their intricate metaphors and profound wisdom, often influence my approach to problem-solving and creative thinking in my technical work.

Beyond poetry and music, I am an avid tea and fragrance connoisseur, with a carefully curated collection of over 50 unique tea varieties and more than 60 different fragrances.
