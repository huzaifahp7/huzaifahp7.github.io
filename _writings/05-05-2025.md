A couple of years back, I found it difficult to start a conversation with people.  
Looking back now, at an opportunity I had during my later teenage years, I wrote:

> “Ek baat kehni thi. Do kalaam baaki the. Teen alfaz adhure the. Chaar haruf be asar the. Bolne ke liye waqt hi guzar gaya.”

This roughly translates to:

"There was **one** thing I wanted to say.  
**Two** lines remained unsaid.  
**Three** words remained incomplete.  
**Four** letters lost their meaning.  
And the time to speak simply passed by."

Sometimes, the moment slips away, and all that remains are the words we wish we had spoken.
