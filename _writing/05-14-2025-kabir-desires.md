### Two timeless verses from Kabir reminded me how little we truly understand, no matter how much we think we know.

One night, while reading alone, I found myself reflecting on how much I thought I had learned about the world. 20 years. 
It was one of those moments where knowledge feels abundant, where power and understanding seem within reach, almost unsurpassable.

And yet, in that very moment, I came across a few verses by Kabir that gave me perspective on how much I truly don't know.
I stumbled upon these verses:

> "Har gyani thak kar haar gaya iss jag ke paar lagane mein  
> Insaan ne kya kya roop kiye iss tere ajaaib khane mein  
> Main kya jaanu Ram tera gorakh dhanda."

> "Kahat Kabir prakat maya phir bhi nar andha,  
> Sab ke gale mein daal diya moh maya ka phanda.  
> Main kya jaanu Ram tera gorakh dhanda."

This roughly translates to:

**First verse:**  
Every wise man, sage, and philosopher has grown weary trying to understand and explain the mechanisms of this world.  
How strange and unusual this world is: how many different forms and guises have humans taken in this wondrous house of yours, O Divine.  
What do I know of your grand design?

**Second verse:**  
Even though the illusions of this world such as its desires, attachments, and temptations are evident, humans remain blind to them.  
Around every neck is the noose of this materialistic pursuit.
What do I know of the workings of your great mystery, O God?

In that moment, I realized how easily we fall into the trap of believing we can comprehend it all.  
Kabir’s words served as an important reminder: humility is essential, and the mysteries of life are often beyond what any mind, no matter how learned, can grasp.
