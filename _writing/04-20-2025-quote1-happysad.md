### A reminder for a friend in a season of transitions.

Towards the end of the Spring semester, a lot of my friends were worried for various reasons such as job applications, graduation, finals, etc.
However, a friend of mine was stressed about life without any particular reason.

Thinking about his situation, I wrote to him in the morning:

> “Jab gham na ho, toh khushi se mehroom rehne mein kya faida.  
> Aur jab gham ho, toh khush rehne se behtar kaunsi barakat.”

This translates to:  
*"If there is no reason to be sad, what is the point in being deprived of happiness?  
And if there is a reason for your sadness, then there is no bigger blessing than being happy."*
