### A restless mind must remember: the journey is long. 

I had just returned from Boston, pulling an all-nighter for work.  
At 4 AM, it began to rain in Atlanta: soft and sudden, in the quiet of the night.  
As dawn broke, I watched the sun rise through eyes that were barely open.
And in that still moment between rain and light, a few lines came to me.


> Mehd se lagakar lehd tak, fitraton ka imtihaan hai bharpoor,  
> Isiliye musafir, yeh yaad rakhna zaroor.  
> Kabhi na ho tujhe kisi baat pe guroor,    
> Kabhi na cheen jaaye tujhse tera yeh noor.

> Kabhi apne khuloos ko na khona,
> Na kabhi aaye tujhe bewajah rona.
> Jaana hai sabko qabr mein, hamesha ke liye sona,  
> Tab banega tere nek amalon ka bichona.

This roughly translates to:

From the cradle to the grave, life tests our good nature in many ways.
That is why a traveler on this path of life must remember this:
Never let pride take hold of you. Never let your inner light fade.
Do not lose your good nature. Do not carry unnecessary sorrow.
In the end, we all must rest forever.
When alone in the grave, your good deeds will be your only companion.
