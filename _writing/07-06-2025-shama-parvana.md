### From self-annihilation to divine union.

While waiting for my ride to the airport, I watched a moth flutter toward a soft glow coming from a light in a small pocket on the street. It was strange because the usual streetlamp, which happened to be much brighter, didn’t seem to catch its attention. Something  more diffused had its full attention.

I often come across the metaphor *shama-parwana* (like a moth to a flame) in various texts, especially in Urdu literature. It symbolizes a reckless devotion and self-annihilation in the pursuit of truth. But what struck me was this:

**What if the moth chooses the flame that will annihilate it?**

That’s when I recalled a *Fareed Ayaz* iterview. He narrates a parable: A common fly asks the King of Moths to raise the status of common flies to that of the moths. The King sends it out to discover the lights of the city. The fly circles the lamps, studies them and returns with detailed reports. But the King dismisses it and says that that was the test. The flies returned, the moths didn't. *True lovers don’t just observe the flame, they vanish into it, they surrender to the light.*

The metaphor stayed with me. Maybe we aren’t meant to just admire what we seek/love. Maybe we’re meant to be undone by it. I have written from the lens of a person seeking truth but the meaning is open for interpretation.

These lines followed soon after:

---

> *Shaayad roshni koi aur zariye se aati ho,*  
> *Magar humein unki soorat hi raas aaye.*  

> Perhaps the light shines from some other source,  
> But to the moth, only one face feels like the flame worth dying for.  

> *Shaayad yeh parwana-dil jal ke fanaa ho,*  
> *Gar woh shama paas aaye.*  

> Perhaps this moth-like heart may burn into nothingness,  
> If ever that flame draws near.  

> *Agar aatish ka khauf ho kisi ko, toh sirf naam ka hai woh parwana,*  
> *Pyaar ki asli ma'ina yehi hai, uss shama pe mar jaana.*

> If one fears the fire, then they're a moth only in name. 
> Because true love means to perish in that flame.

In Sufi literature, the flame is divine truth, and the moth (the seeker/ lover) is only worthy of the name when it stops circling and chooses to burn. To be a parwana isn’t about proximity to light. It’s about letting go. It is surrendering to your source of light. Your flame.

Not every flame is the same. Not every lover, a moth.  
But when both align is when self-annihilation becomes a divine union.
