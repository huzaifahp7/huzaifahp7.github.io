### Some truths shine brighter when we stop chasing the surface and seek the source.

A sunny day in Atlanta took me back to when I was younger, to a time when I often wondered why I couldn't gaze at the sun.
That night, I came up with this:

> There’s this concept of *zahir* and *batin* where *zahir* means what’s on the surface of the faith and *batin* is this inner, more spiritual dimension.  
> *“Often people seek the beauty of the sun’s rays (zahir). Those who seek the beauty of its source (batin) will never be devoid of light.”*

*"Light"* here is open for interpretation.
