### A night. A stranger. Or perhaps something more.

Sometimes, I wonder if the stranger I met that night was a woman, a trace of the divine, or a reflection of myself.

I claim nothing. But there are moments — in silence, in sleep, in the turning of the soul — when one glimpse becomes a mirror, and every face begins to reflect the same light. This poem is a tribute to such a moment. Maybe the Faceless Beloved. Maybe a significant other. Maybe just a dream. I try to capture this very sentiment in Urdu, Farsi and English. Excuse the broken Farsi. Any suggestions on any grammatical aspect and usage of words would be greatly appreciated, feel free to reach out.

**Yeh ajnabi kaunsi paheli hai,**  
*What's the mystery behind this stranger?*  
**Shaayad yeh sunsaan raat ki koi parchhai, ya koi saheli hai.**  
*Perhaps a shadow or a friend of the desolate night.*

**Shaayad yeh raat ki koi jaadugari hai,**  
*Perhaps some enchantment,*  
**Shaayad ek vehem jo yaadon mein bas gayi hai.**  
*Or just a delusion etched in my memory.*

---
**Shaayad uss be-misaal ki raat ki woh tajalli thi,**  
*Perhaps she was the divine radiance of that extraordinary night,*  
**Ya digar alam se bheji hui koi jaam-e-tasalli thi.**  
*Or an elixir of consolation sent from another realm.*

---

**Do lahze raa baa aan ajnabi gozarandam,**  
*Two moments spent with that stranger,*  
**Na mitavaanam faraamush konam, na tammaam be yaad aaram.**  
*I can neither forget, nor fully remember.*
---

**Che konam baa del-e naadaan ke be-rehem o be-qaraar ast,**  
*What do I do with this naïve heart, unkind and restless?*  
**Har taraf insaan ghamgin o pareshaan ast.**  
*Everywhere I turn, I find man worried and lost.*

---

**Shaayad agle subh shams ki pehli kiran se hi woh mujhse naa-waaqif ho gayi,**  
*Maybe at dawn, the first ray of the sun made her forget me entirely,*  
**Shaayad main hi uske liye sirf ek guzarta saya tha, isiliye woh laapata ho gayi**  
*Or perhaps I was only ever a passing shadow to her, which is why she disappeared.*

---


**Shaayad uska laapata hona — yeh baat mujhe raazi thi,**  
*Perhaps I had already accepted her disappearance,*  
**Kahaani jo na puri hui, bas ban gayi maazi thi.**  
*A story unfinished, that simply became my past.*
---

**Shaayad woh do lamhon ne hi de diya tha uska asli pata,**  
*Perhaps those two moments held her only true address,*  
**Na zarurat thi vaadon ki, na thi koi wafa ki khataa.**  
*No need for promises, no betrayal in loyalty.*
---

**Aksar sochta hoon ke kya woh firdaus ka koi paara thi,**  
*I often wonder if she was a fragment of paradise,*  
**Iss saa’il ko apne aap ko dhoondhne ka sahara thi.**  
*who became this seeker’s path back to himself.*

---

**Ek jhalak uski paane ki hai talab aisi,**  
*The longing for her glimpse is quite persistent,*  
**Ke zameen o falaq mein nazar aaye bas woh hi, uss raat jaisi.**  
*That in earth and sky I see only her — like that night, unforgettably.*

This poem is not about a specific person. At least that's not what I had in mind.
It's about **a face that appears and vanishes**, but never quite leaves you.  
It's about **longing**; longing for something the heart pursues but intellect cannot fathom. Some long for a lover to spend the rest of their lives with, some long to find themselves, some long for worldly gains, whilst some long for this mystical pursuit of something divine.
This longing sometimes wears the face of love, and sometimes, the face of God.
