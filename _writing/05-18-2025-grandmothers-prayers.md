### O gentle breeze of the heavens, convey my message.

As I boarded my flight from NYC to Atlanta, a familiar tune stirred memories of my grandmother (paternal).
It has been three and a half years since her passing, though I keep her in my prayers every day. 

In her memory, I wrote these lines:

> O Naseem, carry my prayers to the graves of those whose faces time has blurred,
> whose voices echo in my yearning.  
> For in my heart, they live still, as vivid as ever.

**Naseem** means gentle breeze and is often used in Urdu and Persian poetry to represent a messenger of the heart, carrying messages of longing and remembrance. Coincidentally, Naseem happens to be my maternal grandmother's name.
As soon as I landed, I made sure to call her. It had been a few weeks since my last conversation with her.  
These moments on the flight connected my love for both my grandmothers.
