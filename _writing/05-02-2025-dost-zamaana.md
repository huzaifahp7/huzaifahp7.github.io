### Songs of friendship often outlive the wheel of time.

A part of my occasional existential musing is that in certain moments where my mind is relaxed, I remember that nothing is eternal - places, people, and even memories.
But every now and then, a feeling returns. A trace of a bond. A warmth that refuses to disappear.  
And then I think to myself: friendship, in its purest form, hums on in silence, even after all the music has stopped playing.

> Woh waqt bhi guzar gaya, woh raahein bhi veeran ho gayin. 

> Khaali makaan ki tarah, sab kahaniyaan bhi maazi ban gayin. 

> Magar ek nagma dosti ka, hawaon mein ab bhi gungunata hai 

> na saaz badla, na raag, na mehfil ki woh baat.

This was written around the time of a close friendâ€™s graduation. This one's written for my friends.

English Translation:

> That time has passed, and those roads are now deserted.  
> Like empty houses, even our stories have become a part of the past.  
> But a song of friendship still can be heard whistling in the gentle breeze. 
> Its tune is unchanged, its rhythm is intact, and its gathering is eternal.
