### "I could give all to Time." - Robert Frost  
### "Maybe a few things...but I will keep my prayers for now."


On my flight from San Francisco to Washington D.C., I was thinking about the timezone switch from PT to EST and how I would be “losing” 3 hours.  
It reminded me of all the trips over the past few years, and how I have both gained and lost time like this: in cities, in flights, in moments.  

The sun was rising as the aircraft pierced through the clouds. That’s when these two verses came to me: 
one on time and devotion, and the other on truly surrendering to the beloved to understand time.

They build on each other, and I hope the reader enjoys them:


> Waqt ke raaz kaun hi jaane,

> Gardish-e-ayyam ke hum sab ghulaam.  

> Waqt na nikal jaaye bina ibaadat ke,

> Isiliye pee lo iss mai ke pyale se do chaar jaam.

> Waqt khone ka shayad humein aitraaz bhi na tha, 

> Shayad waqt ek raaz bhi na tha. 

> Waqt ko samajhne ke liye sirf ek mashooq ki zaroorat thi   

> Jisko samajhna zaroori bhi na tha.

This roughly translates to:

Who knows the mystery of time?  
We are servants of the wheel of time, we are at its mercy.  
Hopefully, time does not pass by without devotion.  
That’s why I suggest we drink a couple of sips from this cup of wine.

Note: This does not refer to literal wine.  
As is common in traditional Sufi literature, **"wine" here refers to the wine of divine love**. This alludes to intoxication not of the senses, but of the spirit.

Maybe we were not all that bothered by losing time.  
Maybe time itself wasn’t a mystery.  
Maybe, to understand time, all we needed was a beloved.  
**Ironically, understanding the beloved was unnecessary.**
