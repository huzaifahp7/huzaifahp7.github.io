### Sometimes a burden borne by one becomes a balm for another.

From D.C. to New York, the first leg of my summer journeys came to a close. Each location had a lot to offer - NYC, SF, Boston, Chicago, Washington D.C. 
On Saturday night, a brief conversation with a stranger left a lasting impression.

When I came back to my hotel, their words lingered. I thought about how so many walk this earth heavy with worry, yet carry within them an incredible gift: the instinct to help. Even when weary, the heart still reaches outward. I jotted these lines in Urdu, Farsi, and English, trying to capture that very sentiment.  

(Excuse the broken Farsi. Feel free to reach out with any grammatical suggestions.)

**Che konam baa del-e nadan ke be-rehm o be-qarar ast?**  
*What do I do with this naïve heart — unkind, yet so restless?*  
**Har taraf insaan ghamgin o pareshan ast.**  
*Everywhere I turn, I see people worried, weary, and worn.*  

**Magar phir bhi dil ki fitrat mein hai sahara banna,**  
*Still, the heart was made to offer support, to hold, to heal,*  
**Dusro ke darya-e be-kinar museebato ka kinara banna.**  
*To be the shore to someone else’s endless sea of suffering.*  

**Aur jab kabhi gham ke toofaan chha jaen uski kashti mein,**  
*And when storms of sorrow engulf their fragile boat,*  
**Toh aayenge har ins-o-jinn-o-malak, baant ke dukh iss basti mein.**  
*Then humans, jinns, and angels from every realm of existence will gather in this dwelling, sharing every sorrow till it’s light.*

I guess this is what we’re meant for: life will always seed new problems, but how we rise to meet them, and help others do the same, is entirely up to us.
