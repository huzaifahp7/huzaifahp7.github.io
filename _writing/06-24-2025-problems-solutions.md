### A burden endured by one can become a shelter for many.

My trip from D.C. to New York marked the end of the first leg of my summer travel plans. Each place offered something significant — a new rhythm, a quiet reminder, a change in perspective, and the motivation to do more. 
On Saturday night, a brief conversation with a stranger left a lasting impression.

Back at my apartment, their words echoed. I kept thinking about how so many of us move through life burdened by our own worries, yet still carry within us a powerful instinct: to help.
That’s when these lines came to me, trying to capture that very truth.

(Excuse the broken Farsi. Feel free to reach out with any grammatical suggestions.)

**Che konam baa in hayula-ye be-rehem o be-qarar ast?**  
*What should I do with this material world — unkind and restless at its core?*  
**Har taraf insaan ghamgin o pareshan ast.**  
*Everywhere I turn, I see people weary and worried.*  

**Magar phir bhi insaan ki fitrat mein hai sahara banna,**  
*Still, it is in a human’s nature to be a shelter for other beings,*  
**Dusro ke darya-e be-kinar museebato ka kinara banna.**  
*To be the shore to someone else’s endless sea of suffering.*  

**Aur jab kabhi gham ke toofaan chha jaen uski kashti mein,**  
*And when storms of sorrow engulf their fragile boat,*  
**Tab aayenge har ins-o-jinn-o-malak, baantne dukh iss basti mein.**  
*Then humans, jinns, and angels from every realm of existence will gather in this dwelling, sharing every sorrow until it’s light.*

I guess this is the actual "test" of life: life will always seed new problems, but how we rise to meet them, and help others do the same, is entirely up to us.
